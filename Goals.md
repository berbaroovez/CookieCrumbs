[x] give the customer some kind of confirmation/pop up that they have submitted their request
[x] Ability to attach photos
[x] Change the word "Order" to "Submit"

[] the secondary orders page
[] I don't know how important the "Choose Theme" field is. I know that is populated on the dashboard - but for what purpose? If that field is kept - then there's other descriptions that need to be added (birthday, and "shower" should be changed to "baby shower" and "phone call" should be deleted)
[]Also, a field for payment method selection

[] For me, I would want the "preferred contact" field to be deleted
[x] This is written under notes: Have any extra questions or details let us know!.......... that should be put NEXT TO the "Notes" heading if they are suppose to add that information in the notes field.

[x] Changing the order from pending to accepted or completed does nothing. It just reverts back to pending
[x] No totals are populated on the dashboards (monthly revenue/orders) are still at zero
[] Will there be a way to edit the fields? Because this won't be able to be a "one size fits all" type of form
[x] The pick up calendar/dates doesn't show on the home page

[] A seperator for accepted orders, maybe another dashboard page
